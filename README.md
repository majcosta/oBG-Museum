# oBG-Museum
A few venerable oBG/TotSC mods in one convenient WeiDU installer, for both historical interest and safekeeping.

Only the WeiDU code was written by me, and tries to follow the originals' instructions.

The mod contents are exactly as obtained from these sources. All credit goes to the authors and - to the best of my knowledge - they reserve all rights to them.
