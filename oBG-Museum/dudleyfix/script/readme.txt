Installation Instructions
_________________________

1. If you are not familiar with "mods", "WeiDU" or "BG1Tutu" please skip to Step 3 below. Otherwise read on.

2. The fixes on the Dudleyville web site should ONLY be installed with fan-made mods if you know what you're doing. The fixes on the Dudleyville web site were not written in WeiDU and were not written for BG1Tutu. The dialog.tlk update should NOT be installed over any fan-made mods as in its current format it will overwrite the existing dialog.tlk file rather than edit it (i.e. the dialog.tlk update was not written in WeiDU).

3. If you have the 5CD + TotSC CD version, install in the following order:
	1. Baldur's Gate
	2. Tales of the Sword Coast
	3. TotSC Patch BGTalesUK5512 (or equivalent)

4. If you have the 3CD version instead, install it; no patches are needed.

5. Back up:
	1. Everything in your Override folder
	2. DIALOG.TLK (found in the main game folder, e.g. "Baldur's Gate\dialog.tlk")
	2. The files with the .MUS extension in your Music folder
	3. CLERIC1.BS in your scripts folder
	4. BALDUR.GAM and WORLDMAP.WMP in your Save\888888888-Mission-Pack-Save and MPSave\888888888-Mission-Pack-Save folders

6. Install Kevin Dorner's Baldurdash "BG1FixPack11". You do NOT need to install the Baldurdash "BG1TOSCGameTextUpdate11". Please note that the BG1 Baldurdash FixPacks are not compatible with Dark Side of the Sword Coast (a fan-made mod). (http://www.baldurdash.org)

7. Install aVENGER's Racial Traits fix. The contents of the zip file should be placed in your Override folder. Ensure you download the BG1 version of this fix. (http://www.gamesector.co.yu/avenger/files/atraits_bg1.zip)

8. Download the Dudleyfix Zip files below you want to use. Always scan downloads for viruses before opening them. If you are reading this readme then you have already downloaded one of them! There are FIVE Monster FixPacks on total:
	1. FixPack #1 (v1.0)  - Override Fixes
	2. FixPack #2 (v2.09) - dialog.tlk Update * (see notes below)
	3. FixPack #3 (v1.0) - Music Fixes
	4. FixPack #4 (v1.0) - Script Fixes
	5. FixPack #5 (v1.0) - Mission Pack Save Game Update
	
9. Extract the contents of your downloaded Zip file(s):
	1. FixPack #1 - extract to your Override folder
	2. FixPack #2 - extract to your main game folder (e.g. "Baldurs Gate")
	3. FixPack #3 - extract to your Music folder
	4. FixPack #4 - extract to your scripts folder
	5. FixPack #5 - extract to your Save\888888888-Mission-Pack-Save and MPSave\888888888-Mission-Pack-Save folders

10. You will need to start a new game for all the fixes to be implemented.

11. You are also advised to delete the AREAxxxx.bif files in the cache\data folder otherwise fixes to Areas will not take effect. If you do not have a cache\data folder then don't worry - this is normal if you haven't played a game.


What if a fix doesn't work?
___________________________

1. Firstly, ensure you've followed the instructions above.

2. Try a fresh install of the game, remembering not to install other mods (unless you are familiar with how each mod affects individual files - this means you will probably be a modder yourself).

3. If you have installed a Dudleyfix FixPack and a particular fix does not work as described please drop me an email. Please provide as much detail as you can. If you can repeat the bug from a saved game then do so and take some notes of what happened and how it differed from the intended results. If NONE of the fixes work then you've probably installed the FixPack incorrectly.

4. If all else fails, you've backed up your various folders, so you should be able to remove the Dudleyfixes and replace the original files.
